- Check availability
- Sync confirmed lessons with Google Calendar
- Reduce manual back-and-forth with clients

The goal is simple:  
**less admin, more skiing.**

## 🛠️ Environment variables

The landing page talks to Supabase via `/api/instructors`; this route runs server-side and requires the following env vars:

- `SUPABASE_URL` – the full URL of your Supabase project (service role endpoint).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` – the service role key, never exposed to the browser.

If either value is missing, `/api/instructors` responds with HTTP 500 and a clear log message telling you which variable is absent.
